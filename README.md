## Why Dango?

* **Written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)**: You can trust Dango to NOT crash at runtime. (does not guarantee zero panics)

* **Performance**: Dango is simple and lightweight yet fast. If you dare, you can even embed Dango into your Rust projects.

* **Extensible**: Dango is easy to extend with native functions. (but you can't have custom objects so skill issue)

* **Active Development**: Unlike [Mango](https://github.com/raiseAfloppaFan3925/mango) and [Nonstraightforward](https://github.com/raiseAfloppaFan3925/nonstraightforward), Dango is always in development. In case it isn't, then page me on GitHub or on Esolang.

## Quick Start

Wait until I make a useless wiki on GitHub pages.

## Installing the Source

It's as simple as this.

```
git clone https://github.com/raiseAfloppaFan3925/dango-esolang.git
```

## Examples

* Humble "Hello, world!"

```
eat (')(Hello, world!)----
```

* Avant-garde cat program

```
eat (:io-input)----
```

> **Note**: raiseAfloppaFan3925 does NOT guarantee the [Turing-completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) of Dango. It is up to you to test if this language is Turing-complete. If it's not, then feel free to tell me why and I have a 1 in 1.41421 chance of making a Turing-complete version.

> **Serious Note**: Dango is an [esolang](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), so I don't actually expect that you migrate your projects from C/C++/Rust/Python/Ruby/Swift/Scala/JavaScript/TypeScript/Yappacino/Nonstraightforward/WhateverLanguagesYouAreUsing to Dango.
