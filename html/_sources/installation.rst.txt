Installing Dango
================

.. note::

    Currently, there is no way to install Dango other than from source. I might add it to `crates.io <https://crates.io>`__
    soon, however I'm too lazy to do it and there's already a crate with a similar name. If you REALLY want me to add Dango to crates.io,
    go and push me to do so on `the Esolangs wiki <https://esolangs.org/wiki/User talk:RaiseAfloppaFan3925>`__ or on the
    `GitHub repository <https://github.com/raiseafloppafan3925/dango>`__ and I might do it.

Prerequisites
-------------

* Rust (min. edition 2024)
* Git

Installation
------------

Currently, the only way to install Dango is from source. To do this, run this command.

.. code-block:: shell
    
    $ git clone https://github.com/raiseAfloppaFan3925/dango.git

Then, build it using ``cargo build --release``. If you want to use Dango from the command line, then add the executable
to your ``PATH`` environment variable.
